# My Awesome Markdown File

This is some text with a link to [Google](https://www.google.com)

- This is a list item
  * This is a nested list item
    + This is a deeply nested list item

> This is a blockquote.

**Bold text** and *italic text* can be done this way.

~~Strikethrough text~~ is also supported.

## Conclusion

That's it for now! Hope you enjoyed this messy Markdown file.
